# Introduction

Micro addresses the key requirements for building cloud-native systems. It takes the microservice architecture pattern and transforms 
it into a set of tools which act as the building blocks for scalable platforms. Micro hides the complexity of distributed systems and 
provides well understood concepts to developers.

## Get Started

Start writing services using [go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro).

## Overview

The main piece of software provided is [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro), a cloud-native toolkit.

The toolkit is composed of the following features:

- [**`api`**](api.html) - API Gateway. A single HTTP entry point. Dynamic routing using service discovery.

- [**`web`**](web.html) - Web Gateway and dashboard. Build web apps as microservices.

- [**`cli`**](cli.html) - Command line interface. Describe, query and interact directly from the terminal. 

- [**`bot`**](bot.html) - Slack and hipchat bot. The CLI via messaging.

- [**`new`**](new.html) - New template generation for services.

Micro builds on [go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro), making it a pluggable toolkit.
