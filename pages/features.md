# Features

The micro ecosystem is rapidly growing but there's still a lot to do.

The features page keeps track of the most important or noteworthy features.

- [Framework](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) for writing services
- [Toolkit](https://github.com/micro/micro) to access services
- [Examples](https://github.com/micro/examples) demonstrating usage
- [Explorer](https://micro.mu/explore/) to search OSS contributions

## [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro)

Micro is a toolkit to query and access microservices

* API Gateway as a single http entry point
* Web Dashboard to visualise services
* CLI for command line access
* Bot to query via Slack or HipChat
* New template generation to get started quickly

## [Go Micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro)

Go Micro helps you write microservices

* Abstracts away distributed systems
* Service discovery, rpc, pubsub, message encoding
* Fault tolerant with timeouts, retries and load balancing
* Extensible functionality via wrappers
* Pluggable interfaces to swap out backend technologies

## [Go Config](https://github.com/micro/go-config)

Go Config manages the complexity of config

* Dynamic - load config on the fly as you need it
* Pluggable - choose which source to load from; file, envvar, consul
* Mergeable - merge and override multiple config sources
* Fallback - specify fallback values where keys don't exist
* Observable - Watch the config for changes

## [Go Plugins](https://github.com/micro/go-plugins)

* Plugins for go-micro/micro
* Includes most popular backend technologies
* grpc, kubernetes, etcd, kafka, etc
* Battle tested in production

## Deployment

* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/micro/kubernetes)
* [Docker Compose](https://github.com/micro/micro/blob/master/.compose.yml)
